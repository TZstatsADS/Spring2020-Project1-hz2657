# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The lyrics dataset is also available here [lyrics.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tfv5v73z0ec8vr/lyrics.csv?dl=0). [click to view the file]

The preprocessed dataset is stored in 'output' folder.
