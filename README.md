### [Project Description](doc/)


Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Listen?! Can you tell the difference between Country & Pop, Hiphop & R&B
+ This project is conducted by [Huizhe (Sunny) ZHU]

+ Project summary: Some music lovers can distinguish different types of songs easily. However, many people including me, can only distinguish the popular songs and classical/traditional songs, but not the exact genre sometimes, especially Country and Pop, Hiphop and R&B. For this purpose, this project is established to use real-world database to identify the characteristics of these genres from [lyrics.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tfv5v73z0ec8vr/lyrics.csv?dl=0).
